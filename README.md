# cpp-working-files

These files work for building a C++ worker without error in SpatialOS v9. Place these files in your C++ worker directory, unpackage the C++ worker sdk using "spatial worker_package unpack", change the filenames and parts of the files which say "your project name here" to match yours then run spatial build.
